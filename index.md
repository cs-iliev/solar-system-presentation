## Mercury

![title image](images\planets\Mercury\Mercury_with_magnetic_field.png)

Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.

Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat,
it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, 
ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.

Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. 
It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).
Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. 
Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

Mercury distance from earth is 210.42 million km

## Venus

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon,
Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size,
 mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. 

The diameter of Venus is 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's.
Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide,
with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.

Venus distance from earth is 77.876 million km

## Earth

![title image](images\planets\Earth\Earth\The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.png)

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life.
29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water,
mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers,
and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.

The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation.
Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid,
whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.

Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). 
It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%),
and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation,
the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%),
and less than 1% trace elements.

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur,
and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%.
Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.

## Mars

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[19] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.
