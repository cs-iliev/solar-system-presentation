## Mercury

![title image](images\planets\Mercury\Mercury_with_magnetic_field.png)

Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.

Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat,
it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the Solar System, 
ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.

Mercury is one of four terrestrial planets in the Solar System, and is a rocky body like Earth. 
It is the smallest planet in the Solar System, with an equatorial radius of 2,439.7 kilometres (1,516.0 mi).
Mercury is also smaller—albeit more massive—than the largest natural satellites in the Solar System, Ganymede and Titan. 
Mercury consists of approximately 70% metallic and 30% silicate material.

Mercury distance from earth is 210.42 million km

Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. 
As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky after the Moon,
Venus can cast shadows and can be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad daylight.

Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size,
 mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. 

The diameter of Venus is 12,103.6 km (7,520.8 mi)—only 638.4 km (396.7 mi) less than Earth's—and its mass is 81.5% of Earth's.
Conditions on the Venusian surface differ radically from those on Earth because its dense atmosphere is 96.5% carbon dioxide,
with most of the remaining 3.5% being nitrogen.

Venus distance from earth is 77.876 million km

## Earth

![title image](images\planets\Earth\Earth\The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.png)

Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbour and support life.
29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water,
mostly by oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by lakes, rivers,
and other freshwater, which together constitute the hydrosphere.

The shape of Earth is nearly spherical. There is a small flattening at the poles and bulging around the equator due to Earth's rotation.
Therefore, a better approximation of Earth's shape is an oblate spheroid,
whose equatorial diameter is 43 kilometres (27 mi) larger than the pole-to-pole diameter.

Earth's mass is approximately 5.97×1024 kg (5,970 Yg). 
It is composed mostly of iron (32.1%), oxygen (30.1%), silicon (15.1%), magnesium (13.9%), sulfur (2.9%), nickel (1.8%), calcium (1.5%),
and aluminum (1.4%), with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to mass segregation,
the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%),
and less than 1% trace elements.

The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulfur,
and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%.
Over 99% of the crust is composed of 11 oxides, principally silica, alumina, iron oxides, lime, magnesia, potash, and soda.

## Mars

![title image](images\planets\Mars\Mars\Mars.jpg)

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet".[17][18] The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance (as shown), that is distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.[19] Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars trojan.

## Jupyter

![title image](images\planets\Jupyter\Jupiter\Jupiter.jpg)

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium constitutes one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.

Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800 million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit. Jupiter has 80 known moons and possibly many more, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.

## Saturn

![title image](images\planets\Saturn\Saturn.jpg)

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture. Its astronomical symbol (♄) has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho with a cross-bar, as an abbreviation for Κρονος (Cronos), the Greek name for the planet. It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century.

The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") for the planet Saturn.

Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as on Neptune.

The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 83 moons are known to orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial atmosphere.

## Uranus

![title image](images\planets\Uranus\Uranus\Photograph of Uranus in true colour.jpg)

Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. 
Its name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who, according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars),
grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus (Saturn).
It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune,
and both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn.


Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium,
but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with traces of other hydrocarbons.

It has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex, 
layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.

## Neptune

![title image](images\planets\Neptune\Neptune\Photograph taken by NASA's Voyager 2 in 1989.jpg)

Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by diameter,
the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus.
Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi).
It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.


Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus.
Its atmosphere forms about 5 to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10 to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa,
or about 100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere.
Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions of the atmosphere.

The mantle may consist of a layer of ionic water in which the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions,
and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions float around freely within the oxygen lattice.
At a depth of 7,000 km, the conditions may be such that methane decomposes into diamond crystals that rain downwards like hailstones.
Scientists also believe that this kind of diamond rain occurs on Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus.

## Pluto

![title image](images\planets\Pluto\Pluto\Northern hemisphere of Pluto in true color, taken by NASA's New Horizons probe in 2015.jpg)

Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. 

It was the first and the largest Kuiper belt object to be discovered. 

After Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was declared to be the ninth planet from the Sun.

The New Horizons spacecraft performed a flyby of Pluto on July 14, 2015, becoming the first and, to date, only spacecraft to do so.

During its brief flyby, New Horizons made detailed measurements and observations of Pluto and its moons. 

In September 2016, astronomers announced that the reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, 
organic macromolecules that may be ingredients for the emergence of life, and produced from methane, 
nitrogen and other gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred 19,000 km (12,000 mi) to the orbiting moon.

Pluto's diameter is 2376.6±3.2 km and its mass is (1.303±0.003)×1022 kg, 17.7% that of the Moon (0.22% that of Earth).
Its surface area is 1.779×107 km2, or roughly the same surface area as Russia. 
Its surface gravity is 0.063 g (compared to 1 g for Earth and 0.17 g for the Moon).

The Pluto Files: The Rise and Fall of America's Favorite Planet is a book written by the astrophysicist and Hayden Planetarium director Neil deGrasse Tyson. 

The book is about Pluto, which was demoted to the status of dwarf planet in August 2006 by the International Astronomical Union, thereby depriving it of its planet-hood.

The book also focuses on the fact that many Americans rallied their support for this icy dwarf on the edge of the Solar System because it was discovered by an American.

The book was given a good review by Jon Stewart in a guest segment with Tyson on The Daily Show. During the interview, Stewart humorously lauded the book as "the most exciting book about Pluto you will ever read in your life," as well as "the compelling story of how [Tyson] destroyed Pluto's life."[3]

The book explains in full detail the journey of Pluto's life from its days as Planet X, to its discovery in the early 20th century and all the way to its current title as a Trans-Neptunian object.

The book appeared on the extended hardcover nonfiction bestseller list in The New York Times in February 2009.
